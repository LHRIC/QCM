# Quarter Car Model (QCM)
The dynamics of the suspension of a vehicle can be analysed by running simulations (or solving differential equations) through a mathematical model. The simplest model of a vehicleâ€™s suspension is called quarter-car suspension model or QCM.

The model consists of two mass bodies, an unsprung and sprung mass, and lumped parameters for stiffness and damping.
